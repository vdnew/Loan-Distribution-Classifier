The idea behind this project is to build a model that will classify how much loan the user can take based on their profile.

It is based on the user's material status, education, number of dependents, and employement.

What this project will have:

* Data Preprocessing 
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Training and Testing split
* Model training
* Model Evaluation
